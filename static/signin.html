<!--
For now sign-up will be a feature of only the main page and logout will be a 
feature of every page. Later we may want to let non-signed in users see other
parts of the webpage but control what they are able to do unless they sign-in;
in which case we would have them be able to sign-up from every page. 
Later sign-up and logout should occupy a common spot on a task bar that is
often seen on most websites in the top right hand corner of every page.
